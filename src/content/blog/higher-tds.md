As the financial year progresses, many individuals are discovering discrepancies in their TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) records. This is particularly relevant for those who faced higher TDS deductions due to the non-linking of their PAN (Permanent Account Number) with Aadhaar. If you have since linked your PAN and Aadhaar, this blog is here to guide you through the process of claiming a refund for the excess TDS deducted.

# Why Was Higher TDS Deducted?

The government of India mandates the linking of PAN with Aadhaar to ensure compliance with tax regulations. Failure to do so results in higher TDS deductions at a rate of 20%, as opposed to the usual rates. However, if your PAN-Aadhaar linking is now complete, you are eligible to claim a refund of the excess TDS by filing your Income Tax Return (ITR).


## Key Points to Note

- **Eligibility**: You are eligible for a refund if your PAN was not linked with Aadhaar at the time of deduction but has since been linked.
- **Deadline to File**: Ensure that you file your ITR by 31st December 2024 to claim the refund for the excess TDS deducted.
- **Form 26AS**: Verify if your TDS details are reflecting correctly in your Form 26AS, a statement that consolidates all your tax-related information.
